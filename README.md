# Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot  

![Design](https://github.com/Brianhulela/rag_chatbot/blob/master/images/chatbot_plan.jpg)

In this project, we’ll build a web application that mimics the functionality of ChatGPT, integrating Firebase, AWS, React, and OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to create a powerful, scalable chatbot solution. The system is highly customizable and can be adapted for various use cases, such as content creation, sentiment analysis, education, and more.

## Introduction  

Chatbot applications have transformed how we interact with technology, from customer service to personal assistants. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable and intelligent chatbot leveraging modern tools and frameworks.  

The chatbot is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation, Firebase for real-time backend services, AWS for cloud infrastructure, and React for an interactive user interface.

## Features  

1. **AI-Powered Conversations**  
   - Utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-4 API to generate human-like responses.  

2. **Customizable Use Cases**  
   - Adapt the chatbot for applications like content creation, sentiment analysis, education, and more.  

3. **Real-Time Chat**  
   - Synchronize chat history across devices using Firebase Firestore.  

4. **User Authentication**  
   - Secure login functionality with Firebase Authentication (Google, email/password, etc.).  

5. **Serverless Scalability**  
   - Use AWS Lambda for backend tasks like logging, API monitoring, and additional processing.  

6. **Persistent Chat History**  
   - Store chat history for seamless user experiences across sessions.  

7. **Scalable Deployment**  
   - Host the application using Firebase Hosting for a fast and secure user experience.
